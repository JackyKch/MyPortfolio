            September 14th 2022. LeFive Créteil. Field n°4. 10-8. That day was the first game since when I started this project. Since this game, I have been collecting data from each of my 5-a-side weekly football games with the aim of analysing and tracking the performance of each player. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Thanks to the game videos offered by LeFive, I wondered if I could analyse my own games in more details rather than just looking back at the videos and seeing who scored during a single game. At the same time, I was learning how to use Power BI and needed some real data to properly start using it. This was a perfect match. I had an angle of study, data available and a new tool to discover. 
          </p>

          <h3>
            What's the target ?
          </h3>

          <p>
            As I said before, LeFive provides us a one-angle video of each game and a score sheet where you have all the goalscorers and videos of each goal when clicking on the minute at which the goal was scored. We are able to know who scored the goal as we select on a tablet which player scored so that the scoreboard is updated while we play. Something to take into account is that the videos are available around 3 months and are deleted after. 
          </p>

          <img src="../assets/img/portfolio/five/statsheet.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">

          <p> 
            In the videos, we have a view from one corner of a field which allows us to observe the build-up of each goal. Thereby, there is a lot of information to learn from these videos. We can easily with which foot the player scored with, was it his preferred foot, who assisted the goal and with which foot. Therefore, thanks to these videos, I was able to manually collect various data about our games in a Google Sheets and then use them to build a report with multiple analysis axes.
          </p>

          <h4>
            "It would be cool to also have the assists."
          </h4>

          <p>
            Adding the assists is interesting, but what about the most important statistics in football ? Yes, did you win the game in the end ? By collecting these stats, we easily know which players won and who lost. Another objective was to establish different rankings to see which players won the most, scored the most or assisted the most. This would give an overall view of a player's contribution rather than having single games observations which wouldn't be representative of a player's impact. We would see who is the Cristiano Ronaldo or the Kevin de Bruyne among our group of friends.
          </p>

          <p>
            When creating the dashboard, I had different lines of thinking which would become the different pages in my dashboard. I wanted to have multiple pages which would allow me to answer questions such as "Do I score a lot with my weak foot ?", "Is there a curse field ?", "Am I on a loosing streak ?", "Do I score more during the first half of a game ?". All these questions shaped my dashboard and the visuals that I built.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Standings
          </h3>

          <img src="../assets/img/portfolio/five/standings.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">

          <p>
            In this page, I wanted a simple view on the players who won the most games, the top scorers and the players with the most given assists. As I started this project in October, I couldn't get the assists for the two games played in September because the videos were not available anymore. To be able to have a representative visualisation for each table, I added the win percentage, the goals per match and assists per match ratios so that the players with the best percentage/ratio would be featured.
          </p>          

          <h3>
            Goal Analysis
          </h3>

          <img src="../assets/img/portfolio/five/goal_analysis.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">

          <p>
            In this second page, I wanted a focus on the goals scored during the game, see the best scorers overall and during a single game. I also took a look at the goal distribution by body parts and by quarters of the game as we usually play 1-hour games. The last visual allows me to see how much goals we scored at each game.
          </p>

          <h4>
            "Who scored the most during a single game ? And how much did he actually score ?"
          </h4>

          <p>
            These visuals allow me to see how the average number of goals per game but also to see if some games can be considered as outliers and, in reality there are a lot. We can see that sometimes, there are a lot more goals than the average but, the opposite is also true. This can be explained by some games lasting shorter due to players coming late to the game or just because strikers were in great form during a game.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another interesting fact is to see in which quarter do we have the most or the least goals scored. Due to the intensity of the games, players tend to defend more in the beginning of games. That is why we have the least goals scored in the first quater while we see a lot more goals during the rest of the games when players slow down to catch their break, and be ready for the money time.
          </p>
