            October 5th 2020. NBA Finals. Game 3. 115-104. Miami Win. 2-1 for the Lakers. 40-11-13. These are Jimmy Butler's numbers after an all-time NBA Finals performance. With 40 points, 11 rebounds and 13 assists in 45 minutes, Butler led the Miami Heat to a crucial win over the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James and Anthony Davis. 
          </p>

          <p>
            That performance caused a sensation and shone a light on how commited and how much a leader is Jimmy Butler. He left it all on the court, showcasing the whole world how good a player he is on both sides of the floor and how commited he is. Such a performance in such a complex difficult situation, with his team's back to the wall and multiple teammates unable to play, Jimmy Butler delivered when his team needed him the most.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Underrated from the beginning
          </h3>

          <p>
            When looking back at Jimmy's history, the first thing you might hear about is his difficult childhood. Abandonned by his father when he was an infant, he had to grow up without a father in a tiny town on the outskirts of Houston. If you don't know his story, you must be thinking the next sentence will be about how his mother helped him become the man he is today. In a way she did, but not in a way you are probably expecting. At age 13, she kicked him out of the house and left him with these words: “I don’t like the look of you. You gotta go.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Having to bounce between the homes of various friends, staying for a few weeks at a time before moving to another house. Living in such a way must forge your character but it wasn't the case for Jimmy. What made Jimmy Butler who he is his tremendous work, his grit and toughness. These values obviously ensue from his difficult experiences but also his time in the Leslie family, who accepted him in their family, in which he had to stay out of trouble, work hard in school and be a role model for the other kids. As you may know, being a role model is kind of natural trait when talking about JB nowadays.
          </p>

          <p>
            Butler's basketball debut dates back to his time in Tomball High School, Texas. Only ranked 73rd in the state, Jimmy didn't receive any offers from major college programs. He went to play at a junior college before transferring to Marquette University. Considered a two-star recruit by 247Sports, he was listed as the No.127 junior college prospect in 2008. Constantly improving his stats during his three seasons at Marquette, Jimmy learned a lot with Buzz Williams, Marquette head coach who was tough on Jimmy because of how much he believed in him. That's why, as Butler said, "he introduced me to this whole hard work thing" and Buzz became like a father figure to Jimmy. 
          </p>

          <p>
            However, before the 2011, Butler was still not seen as a valuable asset for many coaches in the NBA. The problem he faced was that many coaches saw him through his story. As famous NBA Coach Doc Rivers said "He's maybe one of the few guys ever in the draft that people got lost in how good of a kid he was. And they couldn't see how good of a player he was.[...] No one saw the talent. And I didn't see it, either. I didn't know he was going to be this good." In the end, Jimmy Butler ended up being selected with the 30th overall pick in the 2011 NBA Draft by the Chicago Bulls. 
          </p>

            <div class="two_images_columns">
              <img src="../assets/img/portfolio/butler/lastnbaseason_pizzaplot.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>
            As we can see, a lot has changed since the 2011 Draft. While Jimmy Butler was selected in the last position of the first round, 29 other players were selected before him. First, we tried to compare how Jimmy ranked compared to them in their last year in college before they got drafted (for those who went to College). Then, we compared their performance in their last full season to date in NBA. Moreover, many players don't even play anymore in the NBA (13 to be exact) whereas Jimmy is well settled in the NBA landscape. 
          </p>

          <p>
            A quick look at both graphs show how much Butler improved in more than 10 years. In all the different areas, Jimmy became better, improving his shooting percentages while playing more minutes and even became one of the best when looking at stats like points, assists and steals. A brief glance at the first graph can offer a beginning of explanation as to why Jimmy wasn't selected by the NBA coaches before that 30th place but it also shows how much they missed by not believing in JB's potential.
          </p>


          <h3>
            Work, work and work
          </h3>
          <p>
            Life as a rookie is never easy, especially when you are not in the first selected players. In Chicago, limited opportunites were offered to Jimmy in his rookie year which saw the lockout shortened the 2011-12 season. But his profile and his desire to show his worth made him a regular player in the Bulls rotation taking part in the 82 games of the following season. His third season saw him become a starter and take on more responsabilities in the Bulls playmaking.
          </p>

          <img src="../assets/img/portfolio/butler/butler_career_stats.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="">

          <p>
            As we see on the plot, this third season marked a significant rise in terms of points scored but also in terms of assists and rebounds. For the people who followed the NBA back in the days, this coincided with the multiple injuries that Derrick Rose suffered. Rose, 2011 NBA MVP and Chicago Bulls point guard was a fundamental player in the Bulls system but due to these injuries someone had to step up and that's what Jimmy did. He was already known for his defensive skills but his offense was still a problem and needed work. 
          </p>

          <p>
            But Jimmy isn't the type of guy to retreat before difficulties. Jimmy Butler worked the same way he always has, he hit the gym, spent hours working on his shot and that translated into a rise in all his shooting percentage during the 2014-15 season, becoming one of Bulls' most trusted offensive weapons. 
          </p>

          <h3>
            One of the best wingers in Europe
          </h3>

          <p>
            Although many changes happened in Son's career, the South Korean still found a way to improve his game.
            Among these changes, we can mention Tottenham's move from their historical stadium of White Hart Lane to the
            freshly built Tottenham Hotspur stadium or the appointment of José Mourinho as Spurs manager following
            Pochettino poor start to the 2019-20 season.
            When speaking of Son, who can forget his memorable pursuit of military service exemption. Indeed, South
            Korean citizens are required to perform a 21 months compulsory military service between the ages of 18 and
            28. Fortunately, Son led the South Korean national team to the gold medal in 2018 Asian Games, after many
            tries, which guaranteed the entire squad's exemption from military service.
          </p>

          <p>
            While being captain of the South Korea national team, Son also plays a major role at Tottenham where he
            became, through hardwork and perseverance, a fundamental key player. A player capable of playing in any
            forward position with an explosive pace, a clinical finishing but also the ability to provide assists for
            teammates. Let's take a look at a stats comparison of Son versus the best European wingers and during the
            2020-21 season. I collected statistics demonstrating his goalscoring, shooting, passing and playmaking
            abilities and looked at where Son stands among the very best.
          </p>

          <img src="../assets/img/portfolio/son/Son - pizza plot.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">

          <p>
            When looking at his Goalscoring per90 stats, we see that Son is pretty good compared to the others as his
            percentile scores are all above 70 except the Expected Goals (xG) which actually shows how impressive this
            season was for the South Korean and how much he outperformed the expectations.
            His Goals/Shots ratio is impressive as he ranks at a 99 percentile score which makes him almost the best
            forward in Europe in terms of Goals per Shots confirming how lethal is Son in front of the goal.
          </p>

          <p>
            Because, as we look at the Shots & Assists percentiles, we see that Son is not a forward taking a lot of
            shots compared to the others but he still managed to make it to a 70 percentile score in terms of Goals
            scored. He stands 96 in percentage of Shots on Target, meaning that Son is really precise when shooting and
            looks for other options when he believes he doesn't have a chance to score. Indeed, having a look at his
            Assists percentile score, he gets the same score that he gets in Goals, which is a 70 percentile score. Son
            has always been regarded as a fanstastic skilled player and these two stats show how true this is.
          </p>

          <p>
            We just said that Son is a clinical finisher, at ease with the ball but also good at finding his teammates.
            His successful dribbles percentage confirms that statement. However, he is not the best at creating Shot
            actions and Goal actions. As we mentionned Son is able to assist his teammates but in the past, situations
            happened during which he kept his head down, ran at goal and took a shot, ignoring therefore his teammates.
            He worked on that during this season, where he delivered no fewer than 14 assists even though he is not
            known for his passing as his passing completion percentage has hovered around 80% during his time at Spurs.
            With José Mourinho's appointment, Son became even more important in the system explaining why he has so many
            Key Passes (KP).
          </p>

          <h3>
            One of the best Asian player in history
          </h3>

          <p>
            Sonny has emerged as one of the Premier League's most prolific forwards over the past seasons. While
            being one of the best, he is still gaining depth in his skillset as his journey continues. A journey
            allowing him to be regarded as one the best Asian players in European football history. He is now a global
            brand able to pique worldwide brands' interest and is considered an icon in his home country and in Asia.
          </p>

          <p>
            To see where Son stands in history, I gathered data about the best East-Asian players in history regarding
            goal involvements meaning: goals and assists. The players include:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><b class="term">Shinji Kagawa</b>, the Japanese midfielder who played for Borussia Dortmund and
              Manchester United. Described as a technically gifted player with a really good sense of passing and
              positioning. His abilities make him a key player in a playmaker role where he can distribute and score
              goals himself. Kagawa holds the record for most appearances and goals by a Japanese player in UEFA club
              competitions.
            </li>
            <li><b class="term">Keisuke Honda</b>, the versatile Japanese attacking midfielder known for his accuracy
              from bending free-kicks, powerful striking and dribbling skills. Honda has played for many clubs around
              the world, but his ability to play as a winger, a false nine or as a deep-lying playmaker allowed him to
              play for CSKA Moscow and Milan.
            </li>
            <li><b class="term">Shunsuke Nakamura</b>, Japanese attacking midfielder. Nakamura played in Europe with
              Espanyol, Celtic and Reggina. At Celtic, he became one of the best Asian players to have ever played in
              Europe; nominated for the 2007 Ballon d'Or, named Scottish Player of the Year and SFWA Footballer of the
              Year. Nakamura has 98 caps and 24 goals for the Japanese national football team.
            </li>
            <li><b class="term">Shinji Okazaki</b>, the Japan national team top active goalscorer and third all-time in
              team history with 50 goals. The forward played most of his career in Europe in clubs like VfB Stuttgart,
              Mainz 05 and obviously Leicester City where he won the Premier League after a wonderful run where the
              Foxes beat all the expectations.
            </li>
            <li><b class="term">Park Ji-sung</b>, the most successful player in Asian history, having 19 trophies in his
              career. Born in South Korea, the midfielder was able to play anywhere across the midfield and was known
              for his exceptional fitness level, discipline, work ethic and off-the-ball movement. These qualities made
              him a key player in Manchester United where he won 4 Premier League titles and a UEFA Champions League.
              Often considered as one of the most underrated player in history, Park was the perfect team player willing
              to sacrifice himself to create spaces for the likes of Ronaldo and Rooney. The latter said that Park was
              as important to the Man United side as he and Cristiano were.
            </li>
            <li><b class="term">Hidetoshi Nakata</b>, widely considered to be one of the greatest Japanese players of
              all time. The midfielder, played most famously for AS Roma, was known for his technical ability, agility,
              vision, passing, and his ability to make attacking runs into the penalty area and score goals.
            </li>

          </ul>

          <img src="../assets/img/portfolio/son/Son - Asian players.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">

          <p>
            At age 28, Son already has 221 direct goal involvements with 151 goals and 70 assists. Looking at the total
            goal involvements at different ages for these players, Son really stands out as he is the only one above the
            150 GI mark even though he is only 29 now. If the South-Korean can maintain his overall output means, he
            could reach levels that will be hard to match for the upcoming Asian footballers.
          </p>

          <p>
            According to the data, Son is therefore on course to become the best Asian player in history. Unfortunately,
            his lack of trophies tarnishes his resume. Son has been starved of trophies to this point in his career.
            Son could reach the heights of players like Park Ji-sung or Kagawa who won many trophies at a club level but
            to do so, he needs silverware which will take him to the next level in his career.
          </p>

          <p>On July 23, Sonny has signed a new four-year contract with Tottenham, which will run until 2025. Let's hope
            that the South-Korean will be able to lead the Spurs to a title and finally fill his trophy room.</p>
